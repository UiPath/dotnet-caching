## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ICache.GetCacheEntryAsync<T>` and `ICache.GetCacheEntriesAsync<T>` — bundled GET + TTL reads. Implementations may fetch the value and its remote expiration in a single network round-trip; `RedisCache` uses a `MULTI`/`EXEC` transaction (mirroring the hash-cache pattern).

### Changed

- `MultilayerCache` and `MultilayerHashCache` no longer issue a separate `ExpireTimeAsync` call after a cache-miss read. They now use the bundled `ICacheEntry.Expiration` returned by the inner cache. For Redis-backed multilayer caches this collapses N + 1 sequential commands to one transaction (one round-trip, one `EXEC` dependency in telemetry) when fetching N keys, eliminating per-key `PTTL`/`EXPIRETIME` traffic on the read path. Public APIs are unchanged.
